                    <strong>Q: I’ve heard that it’s best for my health to eat a salad before dinner. But if I’m eating 
                        vegetables regardless, does the order really matter? </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s a popular internet health hack: Eat foods
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cr1DOaoAinD/?hl=en"> in the “right” order</a> 
                     — vegetables first, 
                    proteins and fats second, carbohydrates last — and you’ll significantly reduce your resulting 
                    spike in blood sugar, which can therefore reduce cravings, fatigue and health risks like Type 
                    2 diabetes, proponents say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Past <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604719/">research</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4876745/"> on </a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561419301542">the </a> 
                    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-015-3841-z">topic</a>, sometimes referred to as nutrient or meal sequencing, has concluded 
                    that it can indeed benefit blood sugar, especially for those with Type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For everyone else, it’s not as cut-and-dried, said Dr. Alpana Shukla, a physician and researcher 
                    at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who has studied food order. Though there are some
                    reasons to consider giving it a try, she said.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    What does the research suggest?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Existing studies on the benefits of meal sequencing are small, but the results are consistent,
                     experts say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In one 
                    <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36574255/">2023 review of 11 studies</a>, for instance, researchers concluded that people who saved
                     carbohydrate-rich foods for the end of a meal, after vegetables and proteins, had
                      significantly lower blood sugar levels than when they consumed them first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In one <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7398578/">2019 study </a>of 15 people with pre-diabetes, Dr. Shukla and her colleagues asked 
                    the participants to eat a meal of skinless grilled chicken, salad and ciabatta in three
                     different orders on three different days: ciabatta first, followed 10 minutes later by
                      the chicken and salad; chicken and salad first, followed by the ciabatta; and salad first, 
                      followed by the chicken and ciabatta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers measured participants’ blood sugar levels right before they ate, and every 30 
                    minutes for three hours after each meal. They found that when the participants ate the 
                    chicken and salad before the bread, their blood sugar spikes following the meal were about
                     46 percent lower than when they ate the bread first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers aren’t entirely sure why this might be. One theory is that eating fats, fiber 
                    and proteins first <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6418004/pdf/fendo-10-00144.pdf">delays stomach emptying</a>
                    , which could slow the absorption of sugars from
                     the carbohydrates into the bloodstream, Dr. Shukla said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Barbara Eichorst, vice president of health care programs at the American Diabetes Association, 
                    said it makes sense for people with Type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes to consume vegetables and
                     proteins first during meals, since, unlike carbohydrates, vegetables and proteins don’t 
                     rapidly turn into sugar and cause high blood glucose spikes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those who have Type 2 diabetes,<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5604719/pdf/bmjdrc-2017-000440.pdf">some limited research </a> even suggests that this blood
                     sugar lowering effect could be comparable with certain diabetes medications, said Nicola 
                     Guess, a clinical dietitian and researcher at the University of Oxford in Britain. Though 
                     more research is needed on the topic.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Should everyone eat like this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Research has also shown that eating carbohydrates last in a meal can reduce blood sugar 
                    spikes <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0260106020975573"> in people who don’t have diabetes</a>. But the experts said that healthy people usually 
                    don’t need to micromanage their blood sugar in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A properly functioning body will bring blood sugar levels back down to normal within hours 
                    after eating a meal, said Dr. Vijaya Surampudi, an endocrinologist at UCLA Health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nonetheless, since proteins, fats and fiber-rich vegetables 
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6123026/#_blank">take longer to digest </a>than simple
                     carbohydrates, saving carbs for last can help people feel fuller for longer, said Dr. 
                     Domenico Tricò, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the University of Pisa in
                      Italy who studies food order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research also suggests that eating this way can stimulate the gut to 
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551485/">produce more of a satiety hormone</a>
                     called glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1. (The 
                     <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/22/well/ozempic-diabetes-weight-loss.html">diabetes drug Ozempic</a> is
                     designed to mimic this hormone.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    “GLP-1 slows digestion and tells your brain you’re not hungry,” Dr. Surampudi said. But
                     some experts said it’s not clear if the small increases in this hormone from meal sequencing 
                     alone (compared with the large increase you’d get from a drug like Ozempic) would make a big
                      difference in how sated you feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you tend to feel sluggish after meals, front-loading them with vegetables or protein could 
                    help, Dr. Shukla and Dr. Surampudi said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/20/4452">research</a> also 
                    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3264798/">suggests</a> that saving carbohydrates for the end of a meal can make you more 
                    likely to fill up on vegetables and protein and eat fewer simple carbohydrates, which tend
                     to have fewer nutrients and more calories, Dr. Shukla said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bottom line, the experts said, is that while meal sequencing is one of many healthy
                     eating strategies, it’s not something to stress about. Dietary trends like these sometimes 
                     result in making people anxious, which can lead to disordered eating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If it’s easy for you, then you should go for it,” Dr. Tricò said. But if not, just aim for 
                    high-quality food you enjoy. Loading up on vegetables at every meal is more important than 
                    focusing too intently on the order of your food, Dr. Guess said.
